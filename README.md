Data Analysis and Visualization Project: NBA Player Performance Dashboard

Scope and Goals: The primary objective of this project was to create an interactive Tableau dashboard that tracks NBA player performance across multiple seasons. The dashboard is designed to showcase key performance metrics, including points, assists, rebounds, and blocks. It allows users to analyze player performance trends, compare different players across their careers, and identify key insights. The goal was to offer a comprehensive view of a player's career, making it easy to understand both basic and advanced aspects of their performance.

Target Audience: This project was intended for hiring managers at the NBA, basketball analysts, and enthusiasts who want to assess my ability to analyze sports data and present it visually. The interactive nature of the dashboard enables users to filter data by player, season, and team, making it a versatile tool for performance analysis and comparisons.

Project Outcome: The outcome of this project was an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of player performance over their career. Users can select individual players, view their stats over various seasons, and analyze key metrics. The dashboard includes visualizations such as:
  ●	Key Metrics Overview: Summarizes total points, assists, rebounds, and blocks, providing a quick snapshot     of career achievements.
  ●	Seasonal Performance Trends: Bar charts displaying metrics like rebounds per season, which help users        track a player's performance over the years.
  ●	Shooting Performance Analysis: Line graphs showing trends in three-point shooting percentage,                highlighting improvements or declines in shooting efficiency.
  ●	Player Information Panel: Displays key information about the player, including birth date, height,           weight, nationality, games played, and total minutes played.

Data Collection: The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle. The dataset, available here, contains player statistics for various basketball leagues, with a focus on NBA data.

Data Cleaning: To ensure data accuracy and usability, the following steps were undertaken during the data cleaning process:
  1.	Data Normalization: Standardized player names and team names to maintain consistency across seasons,         allowing for accurate filtering and comparison.
  2.	Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing values for key stats where feasible; rows with critical             missing data were removed.
  3.	Data Type Conversion: Converted data types (e.g., dates, numerical values) to ensure correct plotting        and filtering in Tableau.
  4.	Feature Engineering: Added new calculated metrics (e.g., three-point shooting percentage) to provide a       more comprehensive analysis of player performance.

Data Analysis and Visualization: The dashboard (as shown in the attached image) was developed in Tableau and features several visualizations:
  1.	Key Metrics Overview: Displays aggregate totals for points, assists, rebounds, and blocks, providing a       summary of career achievements.
  2.	Rebounds by Season: A bar chart visualizing the total rebounds per season, helping users track               consistency and improvement in a player's rebounding ability over time.
  3.	Three-Point Percentage by Season: A line graph that shows trends in three-point shooting accuracy             across different seasons, enabling users to analyze changes in shooting performance.
  4.	Player Information Panel: A section dedicated to detailed player information, such as birth date,            height, weight, games played, and nationality, giving context to their overall performance metrics.

Overall, the project effectively utilizes data visualization to present complex basketball performance data in a clear, engaging, and interactive manner, demonstrating my ability to transform raw data into valuable insights.
